Prorated Subscriptions is an iThemes Exchange add-on that allows you to prorate subscriptions until a preset date.

== Description ==

Prorated subscriptions allows you to prorate subscriptions until a preset date.

For example, if you have a yearly membership that costs $365 and renews January 1, and someone purchases it with only 94 days remaining, they will only pay $94, and their subscription will renew on January 1 instead of 1 year after the day they purchased it.

Requires iThemes Exchange and the Recurring Payments Addon.
